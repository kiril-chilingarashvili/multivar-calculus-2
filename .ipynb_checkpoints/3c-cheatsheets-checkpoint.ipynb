    "## Physical interpretation of divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "### As seen in the warm up problems, divergence is not sensitive to translational motion or rotational motions. What divergence is sensitive to is expanding or contracting motions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two possible physical interpretations, each makes sense in a different context.\n",
    "### 1. Divergence measures how much the flow is **expanding** or **contracting** areas. This makes sense if you are considering the velocity of gases which can expand or contract to fill a volume.\n",
    "### 2. Divergence measures the rate at which fluid is being pumped into the system. Sometimes called a **source rate** or **sink rate**. This makes sense if you are considering the velocity of water, which is incompressible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the explanation above, the terms in orange indicate positive divergence, and the terms in blue indicate negative divergence. We will explore this idea and how divergence shows up when modeling conserved quantities will be explored in the recitation of the next lecture."

    "### Given a velocity field for a fluid, we can ask about the net rate per unit time at which fluid flows across a curve $C$. This net flow rate is known as **flux**. Our convention is that flux is positive when it flows across a parametrized curve from left to right. Flux is naturally described as a line integral across a curve.\n",

    "### Flux is measuring the fluid or particles that flow through a curve per unit length of curve, per unit time, and this depends on the normal component of the velocity field with respect to the curve."
