    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### So far, our integration has taken place mostly in the 2D plane. We started with double integrals, which allow us to measure an accumulated quantity within a two-dimensional region. We have also seen a few types of line integrals, which all involve accumulating certain quantities along curves in two and three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this unit, we introduce **triple integrals** which are the 3D version of double integrals. The main idea is very similar to double integrals, and you will also learn that there are some new coordinate systems available in 3D that are useful for triple integrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "### By the end of this lecture and recitation, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ### Correctly interpret **triple integrals** over solids as the accumulation of a quantity over a solid in three dimensions.\n",
    "- ### Convert a triple integral to an iterated integral in rectangular or **cylindrical coordinates** (for basic shapes).\n",

    "### **Vocabulary**\n",
    "### It is easy to get confused during this transition from 2D to 3D, because there is some new vocabulary. Let's go over this vocabulary now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition 2.1** (Shapes in the 2D plane) \n",
    "### A filled-in shape in the 2D plane is usually called a **region**. For example, the unit disk is a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The boundary of a 2D region is usually called a **closed curve**. The unit circle is a closed curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition 2.2** (Shapes in 3D space) \n",
    "\n",
    "### A filled-in shape in 3D space is either called a **solid** or a **volume**. For example, the unit ball is a solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The boundary of a solid is usually called a **surface**. The unit sphere is an example of a surface.\n",
    "![img](img/img-12-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### To demonstrate the distinction, notice that the origin is a point on the region and solid shown above, but it is not a point on the curve nor the surface.\n",

    "### When we need to integrate a function of three variables $f(x,y,z)$ over a 3D solid, we use a triple integral $\\displaystyle \\iiint$. For example, $f(x,y,z)$ might be the mass density of a three-dimensional solid $R$, which would mean that $\\displaystyle \\iiint_R f(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV}$ represents the mass of this solid.\n",

    "### The original definition of $\\displaystyle \\iiint_R f(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV}$ is a generalization of the definition for double integrals. In other words, $\\displaystyle \\iiint_R f(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV}$ is the quantity that is approached when we divide $R$ into more and more smaller and smaller 3D pieces $A_1, \\ldots, A_n$ centered at $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$, and form the sum:\n",

    "## Applications in 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mass**\n",
    "### We have seen an example of computing the mass of a 3D solid with variable density. This mass is often written using the â€œmass element\" $\\mathop{dm}$ which represents the mass of an infinitesimal piece of the solid. If the density is $\\delta$, then by definition $\\mathop{dm} = \\delta \\mathop{dV}$. So we have:\n",
    "## $$ \\operatorname{Mass}(R) = \\iiint_R \\mathop{dm} = \\iiint_R \\delta \\mathop{dV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Average value**\n",
    "### Just as we did with double integrals, we can take the average value of a function $f(x,y,z)$ over a 3D solid $R$. We have:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Avg. value of}\\, f(x,y,z)\\,\\text{)}\\quad \\overline{f} = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Volume}(R)} \\iiint_R f(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### And we can also find a weighted average with weight function $\\delta(x,y,z)$:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Weighted Avg. value of}\\, f(x,y,z)\\,\\text{)}\\quad \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Mass}(R)} \\iiint_R f(x,y,z) \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Center of mass**\n",
    "### The center of mass (also called â€œcentroid\") of a 3D solid $R$ is found by taking the average values of $x,y$, and $z$ over the solid $R$:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Centroid of}\\, R \\, \\text{)} = (\\overline{x}, \\overline{y}, \\overline{z}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The notation $\\overline{x}$ represents the average value of the function $f(x,y,z) = x$. Explicitly,\n",
    "## $$ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Mass}(R)} \\iiint_R x \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remark 9.1**\n",
    "### Sometimes you can figure out $\\overline{x}, \\overline{y}$ or $\\overline{z}$ from symmetry considerations, instead of needing to do out an integral. But be careful, if the density is not constant, the shape might not be as symmetrical as it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Moment of inertia with respect to an axis**\n",
    "### For a 3D solid with density function $\\delta(x,y,z)$, its moment of inertia about an axis $S$ is:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Moment of inertia of solid about axis}\\, S\\,\\text{)}\\quad \\iiint_R (\\text{distance to}\\,S)^2 \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is the same definition that we used for moment of inertia in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some special cases to consider:\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\displaystyle \\text{(Moment of inertia of solid about }\\,x\\text{-axis)} & \\quad & \\displaystyle  \\iiint_R (y^2+z^2) \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} \\\\ \\displaystyle \\text{(Moment of inertia of solid about }\\,y\\text{-axis)} & \\quad & \\displaystyle  \\iiint_R (x^2+z^2) \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} \\\\ \\displaystyle \\text{(Moment of inertia of solid about }\\,z\\text{-axis)} & \\quad & \\displaystyle  \\iiint_R (x^2+y^2) \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remark 9.2**\n",
    "### There is no need to memorize the above formulas for the moment of inertia about the $x,y,z$-axes. Instead, you can rederive them when they are needed. For example, to compute the moment of inertia about the $x$-axis would require computing the distance from $(x,y,z)$ to the $x$-axis. Since the closest point on the $x$-axis would be $(x,0,0)$, the distance formula (or Pythagorean Theorem) tells us:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{Distance from}\\, (x,y,z)\\, \\text{to}\\,x\\text{-axis}=\\sqrt{y^2+z^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plugging this distance into the definition of moment of inertia gives the formula\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Moment of inertia of solid about }\\,x\\text{-axis)} \\quad \\displaystyle  \\iiint_R (y^2+z^2) \\delta(x,y,z) \\mathop{dV} $$"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Picture**\n",
    "### 1. When we need to integrate a function of three variables $f(x,y,z)$, we use a triple integral $\\displaystyle \\iiint$.\n",
    "### 2. In a triple integral, the domain that we integrate over is a 3D solid $R$.\n",
    "### 3. We can use triple integrals to compute the mass of the solid $R$, its moment of inertia, or the average value of a function over $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mechanics**\n",
    "### 1. When setting up the endpoints for each of the three integrals in $\\displaystyle \\iiint$, we can use any convenient coordinate system. For now, our options are rectangular coordinates $x,y,z$ or cylindrical coordinates $r,\\theta,z$.\n",
    "![img](img/img-12-05.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. As usual, the endpoints for each integral represent the interval of values that each coordinate runs through (possibly dependent on the outer integration variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. If $R$ is a box, then the endpoints for $x,y$, and $z$ will be constants, so we will have something like $\\displaystyle \\int_{x=0}^3 \\int_{y=-1}^1\\int_{z=0}^2$. But if the solid is not a box, the bounds for $x,y$, and $z$ will be functions of the outer integration variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ask Yourself**\n",
    "### **When would we switch an integral to cylindrical coordinates?**\n",
    "### Most often, the switch will happen when setting up the integral, that is, when finding the endpoints of integration. For example, if the solid is a portion of a cylinder, it will be easier to write down the endpoints in cylindrical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How do we decide in what order to do an iterated integral?**\n",
    "### The answer is the same as it was for double integrals: use whichever ordering makes the problem easier. It is often helpful to sketch the solid of integration, which will sometimes give a hint that the integral is more suited to one order or another."
