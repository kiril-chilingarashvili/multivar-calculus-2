    "## Re-ordering integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part of the process of solving a double integral $\\displaystyle \\iint_{R} dA$ is to decide whether to have the inner integral depend on $x$ or $y$. In other words, we need to choose to express $dA$ as $dA=dy dx$ or $dA = dx dy$. Both ways lead to the same numerical answer, but in some cases, one of the orderings will make the problem easier. To illustrate the difference, let's see how we can swap the order of integration in a few examples.\n",

    "### (Exchanging order of integration rectangular region)\n",

    "### The integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^2 \\int_0^1 dx dy$ can be interchanged as:\n",
    "## $$ \\int_0^2 \\int_0^2 dx dy = \\int_0^2 \\int_0^2 dy dx $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Usually it is not as simple as just swapping the two $\\displaystyle \\int$ signs, but it works in this case. The reason this simple swapping is valid for this example is that the region of integration is a rectangle. Therefore, whether we are slicing it horizontally or vertically, the min and max values of $x$ an $y$ are the same either way. We know the region is a rectangle because the possible values for $y$ do not depend on the value of $x$.\n",

    "### Trying to proceed directly, we run into difficulties because there is no simple anti-derivative for the function $\\displaystyle \\frac{e^y}{y}$. This seemingly impossible double integral can, in fact, be solved by interchanging the order of integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To swap the order of integration, we cannot just replace $\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 \\int_x^{\\sqrt{x}}$ by $\\displaystyle \\int_x^\\sqrt{x} \\int_0^1$. One way of seeing that this would be invalid is to recognize that the resulting outer integral would give an answer that depends on $x$. That doesn't make sense, because our final answer should be a number (the volume under a surface).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instead, the right way to swap the order of integration is to figure out what the region of integration is, and slice it in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this case, we are given that $x$ runs through $[0, 1]$ and for a given value of $x$, we have $y$ running through $[x, \\sqrt{x}]$. Therefore, the region is the area between the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=\\sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[0,1]$.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "### ***Big Picture***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ### When we need to find a volume under a graph $z=f(x, y)$, we need to compute a double integral.\n",
    "2. ### Double integrals can be computed by iteration (“an integral of an integral\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Mechanics***\n",
    "1. ### To get from $\\displaystyle \\iint_{R} dA$ to $\\displaystyle \\int_{x=?}^{?} \\int_{y=?}^{?}$, we need to think about the values that $x$ and $y$ run through within the region $R$.\n",
    "2. ### If $R$ is a rectangle, then the bounds will be constants, so we will have something like $\\displaystyle \\int_{x=0}^3 \\int_{y=-1}^1$. But if the region is not a rectangle, the bounds will be functions of $x$ or $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Ask Yourself***\n",
    "### ***Is there a new fundamental theorem of calculus for double integrals?***\n",
    "### No, we use the same fundamental theorem of calculus for single integrals twice. We treat the non-integrated variable as a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***How do we decide in what order to do an iterated integral?***\n",
    "### You should use whichever ordering makes the problem easier. Unfortunately, as with most integration methods, we often do not immediately know which approach will work the best. So we might start with one ordering, such as $dx dy$, see if it works, and if we run into difficulty then try the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is often helpful to sketch the region of integration, which will sometimes give a hint that the integral is more suited to the ordering $dx dy$ or vice versa. But remember: sometimes only one ordering is possible to antidifferentiate, so you might need to try both anyway."
