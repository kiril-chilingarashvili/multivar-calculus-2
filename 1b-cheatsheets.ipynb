In this lecture, you will learn about the most common type of change of variables: switching a double integral to polar coordinates. This technique allows you to replace many complicated integrals with simple ones that can be computed more easily.\n",

    "## Double integrals in polar coordinates\n",

    "### Previously we saw double integrals such as\n",
    "## $$ \\iint_{R} (1-x^2-y^2)dA $$\n",

    "### After converting the double integral to an iterated integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 \\int_0^{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} (1-x^2-y^2) dy dx$, the resulting computation was rather lengthy and required trig-substitutions. This integral becomes easier in polar coordinates.\n",

    "### For the quarter-disk $R$, the range for $\\theta$ is $\\displaystyle [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, covering the first quadrant, and the range for $r$ is $[0, 1]$, since the disk has radius $1$. So far, we have\n",
