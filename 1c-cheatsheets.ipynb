    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the previous lecture, you learned how to change a double integral in rectangular coordinates ($x$ and $y$) to a new double integral in polar coordinates ($r$ and $\\theta$). Switching from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates is one example of “changing variables\" in a double integral. In this lecture, we generalize the idea to allow for switching from any coordinate system to any other coordinate system. This is useful for solving double integrals that happen to be more suited to an alternative coordinate system.\n",

    "### In addition, some of the ideas in this section will come up again later in calculus when we need to parametrize surfaces in higher dimensions.\n",

    "## Area of an ellipse\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our first example of “change of variables\" comes from the following question: how can we find the area of an ellipse using double integrals?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The equation for an ellipse is\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Equation for ellipse)} \\quad \\left( \\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2 = 1  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### If we wanted to find the area of this ellipse, we would need to integrate (with integrand $1$) over the interior region of the ellipse:\n",
    "## $$ \\text{(Area of ellipse)} \\quad \\iint_{\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2 < 1} \\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### This integral looks very close to one that we can solve with polar coordinates. But in order to use polar coordinates, we would like to get rid of the denominators in $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2$ and $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To that end, we can introduce new variables $u$ and $v$ where\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} u & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{x}{a} \\\\ v & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{y}{b} \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Then the region $\\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2 < 1$ becomes just $u^2+v^2<1$. So far we have:\n",
    "## $$ \\iint_{\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2 < 1} \\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy} = \\iint_{\\displaystyle u^2+v^2<1} \\cdots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### To fill in the $\\cdots$, we need to replace $\\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy}$ with $\\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv}$, possibly with some scaling factors. In this example, we can say\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\displaystyle u = \\frac{x}{a} & \\implies & \\displaystyle \\mathop{du} = \\frac{1}{a}\\mathop{dx} \\\\ \\displaystyle v = \\frac{y}{b} & \\implies & \\displaystyle \\mathop{dv} = \\frac{1}{b}\\mathop{dy} \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thus we have\n",
    "## $$ \\mathop{du} \\mathop{dv} = \\frac{1}{ab} \\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplying both sides by $ab$ shows that we can replace $\\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy}$ by $ab \\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv}$. This gives us the new integral:\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\displaystyle \\iint_{\\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{x}{a} \\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{b} \\right)^2 < 1} \\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy} & = & \\displaystyle \\iint_{\\displaystyle u^2+v^2 < 1} ab \\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv} \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle ab \\iint_{u^2+v^2<1} \\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv} \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle ab \\cdot \\mathop{Area}(\\text{Unit disk}) \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle ab\\pi \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thus the area of the ellipse is $ab\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "### Making the change from $x$ and $y$ to $u$ and $v$ is what we mean by a “change of variables.\" Although it is possible to solve this problem with just $x$ and $y$, the change of variables made the integral much simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For the next few pages, the main focus will be on the $\\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy} = ab \\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv}$ part of the argument. In particular, how do we replace $\\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy}$ with $\\mathop{du}\\mathop{dv}$ if the change of variables is more complicated? You will see that, depending on the specific change of variables, this is usually more involved than it was in this first example."

    "### **Remark 3.1**\n",
    "### As usual in calculus, we approach the general case by first getting a solid understanding of the linear case. In the general case, we will use calculus (derivatives) to approximate nonlinear behavior by linear behavior.\n",

    "### The reason we need this scaling factor is that a small region $A$ in the $xy$-plane contributes a term like $\\mathop{Area}(A)\\cdot f(x, y)$ to the integral, and when $A$ becomes $A'$, we replace $\\mathop{Area}(A)$ by a potentially different area $\\mathop{Area}(A')$. If we were to simply leave $f$ the same, then the resulting term could have a different value, which would impact the value of the integral. So to make sure we do not change the value of the integral, we need to include the scaling factor $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mathop{Area}(A)}{\\mathop{Area}(A')}$ in the new integrand."

    "## Finding the area scaling factor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning to our example, we need to compute the area of the region $A'$, which is the region traced out in the $uv$-plane as $x$ and $y$ run through a small rectangle $A$ in the $xy$-plane.\n",

    "### Why is this true? First, it follows from general facts about matrices that the region $A'$ will be a parallelogram in the $uv$-plane, regardless of where the rectangle $A$ is placed (this is because matrices map parallel lines to parallel lines). Furthermore, the area scaling factor $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mathop{Area}(A)}{\\mathop{Area}(A')}$ doesn't depend on the choice of rectangle $A$ (this is because scaling the input to a matrix will scale the output of the matrix by the same amount, and shifting the input will shift the output, but not stretch it).\n",

    "\n",

Furthermore, for any other rectangle the area is also multiplied by $5$. Thus,\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Picture**\n",
    "### Just like with polar coordinates, it is possible to change the variables of integration to any coordinate system, provided that the area scaling factor is included in the transformed integrand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The technique is known as “change of variables\" and can be used to replace some difficult integrals with simpler ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We also learned about the area scaling factor, given by the absolute value of Jacobian determinant $\\left| \\frac{\\partial(u,v)}{\\partial(x,y)} \\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mechanics**\n",
    "### There are four steps when doing a change of variables $x,y \\to u,v$:\n",
    "1. ### Decide on a change of variables, which can be expressed as $u=\\cdots$ and $v=\\cdots$, or as $x=\\cdots$ and $y=\\cdots$.\n",
    "2. ### Find the replacement for $\\mathop{dx}\\mathop{dy}$ by computing the Jacobian determinant $\\frac{\\partial(u,v)}{\\partial(x,y)}$, or its reciprocal.\n",
    "3. ### Rewrite the new integrand in terms of the new variables.\n",
    "4. ### Compute the new endpoints by analyzing the region of integration in terms of the new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ask Yourself**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When would you use change of variables?**\n",
    "### Change of variables is a technique of integration, so it can be used to simplify difficult integrals. We might use a change of variables because it simplifies the region of integration, or simplifies the integrand, or both. Usually we aim to make some kind of simplification in the integral, so if we see $\\sqrt{3x-2y}$ we would probably choose $u=3x-2y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Are we free to choose any formula we want for a change of variables?**\n",
    "### Not completely, no. Generally we would like to choose formulas so that the change of variables will simplify the integrand or the region of integration. But we are constrained in that the change of variables transformation must be differentiable and one-to-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, if we see an expression like $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{1+xy}}{1-xy}$ in the integrand, we might try to choose $u=1+xy$ and $v=1-xy$ to simplify that. But in fact this will lead to a Jacobian that equals $0$ everywhere, indicating something has gone wrong. The issue is that the transformation is not one-to-one. For instance, the point $(u,v) = (1,1)$ corresponds to the family of points $(x,y)=(t,0)$ for any value of $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instead, we would need to choose something else for $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\sqrt{1+xy}}{1-xy}$ that gives us a non-zero Jacobian. It is often difficult to choose the “right\" change of variables, so we might need to look for insight from the geometry of the problem, or from other problems that are similar."
