    "### You might be more used to seeing density given in dimensions of mass per volume, or mass per length cubed. Here the idea is that the wire is so thin that the cross-sectional area is negligible, so that the mass of a small piece of wire depends only on its length. Therefore, in this thin-wire situation, we can use linear density instead of density, which typically refers to mass per volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we think about the density? It means that the mass of a small piece of the wire near the point $(x,y)$ is equal to the length of that piece of wire multiplied by $\\rho(x,y) = 1+y$.\n",
