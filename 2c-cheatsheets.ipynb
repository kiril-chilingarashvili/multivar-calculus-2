    "## Vector Fields and Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### So far we have explored how to integrate scalar functions $f(x, y)$ along a curve. But in a multivariable context, we have more kinds of functions, including vector-valued functions, also known as vector fields $\\vec{F}(x, y) = \\langle M(x, y), N(x, y) \\rangle$. In this lecture, we begin to explore what it means to integrate a vector-valued function along a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To be able to appeal to the tools that we have for line integrals involving scalar functions, our goal will be apply the same process of breaking up our curve into small pieces. Then to look at an accumulated quantity along our curve, we either look at the magnitude of the vector field that is tangent to our curve, or the magnitude of the vector field that is normal to our given curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We start here by integrating the component of a vector field that is tangent to a curve. This is a quantity that comes up a lot in determining work done by a force field to an object traveling along a curve. We will explain the connection to the physical problem, and the computational methods involved in three different ways. (The next unit will give us the opportunity to explore the normal component of the vector field along a given curve.)\n",

    "## Drawing vector fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computers are able to draw vector fields for you. But if the vector field is simple enough, it is a good idea to do a quick sketch of the vector field to get a sense of what it looks like and how it behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 3.1**\n",
    "### Sketch the vector field $\\vec{F}(x, y) = 2 \\hat{i}+\\hat{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This vector field does not depend on the point $(x, y)$, it is everywhere the vector $\\langle 2,1 \\rangle$. Therefore to draw this vector field, we pick some points in the plane, and from every chosen point, draw the vector $\\langle 2,1 \\rangle $.\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The example above is of a constant vector field, which is a good example to consider. If we zoom in on any vector field, it will appear to be a constant vector field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's look at our first example of drawing a vector field that is not constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 3.2**\n",
    "### The vector field $\\vec{F}(x, y) = x \\hat{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each vector in this vector field points in the horizontal ($\\hat{i}$) direction. The length of the vector depends on the $x$ coordinate of the point $(x, y)$. For example, at the points $(1,0),(1,1)$ and $(1,100)$, the vector is $\\hat{i}$. For negative values of $x$, for example at the point $(-1,0)$, the vector $\\vec{F}(x, y) = -\\hat{i}$ points in the opposite direction. When $|x|$ is small, the vector is short. When $|x|$ is large, the vector is long.\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Procedure for sketching a vector field**\n",
    "### 1. Compute the vector at a few points.\n",
    "### 2. Sketch the vector so that the tail starts at the specified point.\n",
    "### 3. Fill in enough vectors at enough points that you get a sense of the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 3.3**\n",
    "### Sketch the vector field $\\vec{F}(x, y) = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j}$.\n",

    "![img](img/img-6-05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a few points, and drawing the vectors, we see that this vector field has vectors that are everywhere pointing radially outward from the origin, and the length of the vector increases as you move farther from the origin.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question**\n",
    "### What does the vector field $\\vec{G}= -y \\hat{i} + x\\hat{j}$ look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are some options. \n",
    "![img](img/img-6-07.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution**\n",
    "### What does the vector field $\\vec{G} = -y\\hat{i} + x\\hat{j}$ look like? At any point in the plane $(x,y)$, we saw that the vector $\\langle x,y \\rangle$ was the vector from the origin that points to the point $(x, y)$. The vector $\\langle -y, x \\rangle$ is the vector we obtain by rotating the vector $\\langle x,y \\rangle$ $90^\\circ$ counterclockwise.\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-08.png) \n",

    "### Thus to draw this vector field, we make a copy of this rotated vector and place it so its tail begins at the point $(x,y)$.\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-09.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sketching several vectors, what we obtain is a vector field that is always tangent to the circle about the origin pointing in the counterclockwise direction. The magnitudes of the vectors are larger for vectors further from the origin.\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note that this vector field is hard to parse, so we often scale down the vectors so that we can more easily read the plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Answer to Question 1**\n",
    "### If you change the sign in the example from $\\vec{F} = -y\\hat{i}+x\\hat{j}$ to $y\\hat{i}-x\\hat{j}$ you change the direction that the vector field is rotating about the origin.\n",
    "\n",

    "### - In the case $y\\hat{i}-x\\hat{j}$, when $x$ is positive and $y$ is zero, the vector points down. When $x$ is zero, and $y$ is positive, it points right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 2. How do we know that $\\vec{F}(x,y) = -y\\hat{i}+x\\hat{j}$ is rotating with unit angular velocity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer to Question 2**\n",
    "### Recall that angular velocity is a measure of the rate of change of the angle as measured from the origin with respect to time. The velocity is the vector $\\langle -y, x \\rangle$ whose magnitude is the speed. And the speed of purely circular motion is going to be given by the distance from the origin times the angular velocity!\n",
    "![img](img/img-6-12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### So in this case:\n",
    "- ### The velocity is $\\langle -y, x \\rangle$ at the point $(x,y)$.\n",
    "- ### The speed is $|\\langle -y, x \\rangle| = \\sqrt{y^2+x^2}$.\n",
    "- ### We can also write the speed of circular motion as the radius $R$ times the angular velocity: $R\\omega$.\n",
    "- ### The distance from the origin of the point $(x,y)$ is $R = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n",
    "- ### The speed is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = R\\omega = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\omega$. Therefore $\\omega = 1$.\n",
    "\n",

And the force cannot change the trajectory. Imagine that the particle is moving along a track or by a hand. In fact, we are not assuming that the force is what is moving the particle at all."
