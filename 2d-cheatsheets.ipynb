    "### both hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 9.2**\n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, the statements \"$n$ is an even number\" and \"$n^2$ is an even number\" are equivalent. This is because the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd. Therefore, $A$ is even if and only if $B$ is even.\n",
