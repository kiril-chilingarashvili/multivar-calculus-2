    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Big Picture**\n",
    "### Given a vector field $\\vec{F}$, if it satisfies some minimal hypotheses on a region of the plane, then the following are equivalent:\n",
    "### 1. $\\vec{F}$ is conservative ($\\displaystyle \\oint_C \\vec{F}\\cdot d\\vec{r} = 0$ for any closed curve),\n",
    "### 2. $\\vec{F}$ is path independent,\n",
    "### 3. $\\vec{F}$ is a gradient field ($\\vec{F} = \\nabla f(x,y)$),\n",
    "### 4. $\\mathrm{curl} (\\vec{F}) = 0$ **and** $\\vec{F}$ is defined and differentiable everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physically, we care about conservative vector fields because many physical quantities are conserved, that is they cannot be created or destroyed: energy, momentum, mass. Thus in the development of physical models, we would expect our models to retain these modes of conservation, giving us fields whose curl is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The curl of a vector field is itself a multivariable function, which measures how far a vector field deviates from being conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### If the vector field is a velocity field, the curl measures the angular velocity of the motion.\n",
    "- ### If the vector field is a force field, the curl measures the torque per unit moment of inertia on a test object placed in that force field. (That is it measures how the angular velocity is increasing or decreasing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Once we know that our vector field is a gradient field, we can find the potential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mechanics**\n",
    "### Given a vector field $\\vec{F} = \\langle M,N \\rangle$, to test that this vector field is a gradient field (i.e. is conservative), it is enough to check the following:\n",
    "### 1. The vector field is defined (and differentiable) everywhere (or on a simply connected region of the plane).\n",
    "### 2. $\\mathrm{curl}(\\vec{F}) = N_x - M_y = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "### To find the potential function associated with a gradient field, we discussed two methods.\n",
    "### 1. Define $\\displaystyle f(x,y) = \\int_C \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r} + f(P_0)$ for any curve $C$ from $P_0$ to $(x,y)$. Usually we use a curve that makes the integrals easy to compute.\n",
    "### 2. Anti-differentiate using the fact that $\\vec{F} = \\langle f_x, f_y \\rangle$.\n",
    "###    - Anti-differentiate $f_x$ with respect to $x$ to find a function $f(x,y) + g(y)$.\n",
    "###    - Take the partial derivative of the first step with respect to $y$ and compare with your expression for $f_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ask Yourself**\n",
    "### **Can a vector field have zero curl, but not be a gradient field?**\n",
    "### Yes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Can a vector field be conservative, but not be a gradient field?***\n",
    "### No! A vector field being conservative is logically equivalent to being a gradient field."
