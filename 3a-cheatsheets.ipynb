The conclusion of our theorem fails to be true if the region where we are considering our vector field has a hole in it. (We will have to define this carefully later.) But, if for example, the region has no holes, called **simply connected**, then the conclusion of the theorem will hold and we will be able to describe our vector field as a gradient field on the simply connected region."

    "### When applying this method, it is common to use a path that is piecewise, where each piece moves only in the $x$ or $y$ direction because it simplified our line integrals. However, one might have a function that is better described in polar coordinates. In such a case, a line that moves in the radial direction might be more natural. Similarly, for some reason, we might choose to move vertically in the $y$-direction first, then horizontally in the $x$-direction for a specific example where the line integrals simplify further. We will see examples using this approach later."
