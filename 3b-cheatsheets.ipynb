    "### **Can Green's theorem be applied on regions where the vector field is not defined?**\n",
    "### No! This is a necessary hypothesis. If the vector field (or its curl) are not defined on the region $R$ bounded by a curve $C$, then we cannot apply the theorem.\n",

    "### **Is it possible that you can apply Green's theorem on some closed curves, but not all closed curves?**\n",
    "### Yes! If you have a vector field that is not defined or differentiable at a few points on the plane, that is OK! You won't be able to apply Green's theorem on any closed curves that contain points where the vector field or its curl are undefined, but for all other regions, you can apply the theorem!"
