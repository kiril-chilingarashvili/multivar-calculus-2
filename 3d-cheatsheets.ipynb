    "### Yes! It is sufficient to show that a vector field is conservative to know that it is defined on a simply connected region, have its curl defined and zero on a simply connected region. However, it is not necessary! We saw in the last problem that the vector field $\\displaystyle \\vec{F} = \\frac{\\langle x,y \\rangle }{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ is the gradient of the potential function $g(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, and hence is conservative. However, the vector field's domain of definition does not include the origin, and hence is not simply connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Can Green's theorem be applied on any region where defined?**\n",
    "### Almost! Remember that one requirement of Green's theorem is that the region be bounded counterclockwise. We can run into trouble if our region is bounded by a curve like a on the picture below, such that the region is bounded counterclockwise on one half, but clockwise on the other half.\n",
    "![img](img/img-10-20.png)\n",

    "### You can still apply Green's theorem, but you have to do so carefully. In this case, the orientation issue can be resolved by splitting the region into two regions $R_1$ and $R_2$ bounded by $C_1$ which is counterclockwise and $C_2$ which is clockwise.\n",
