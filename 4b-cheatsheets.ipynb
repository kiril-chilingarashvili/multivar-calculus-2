    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the previous lecture, we started computing triple integrals over 3D solids in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates. In this lecture, you will learn about a third coordinate system that is frequently useful for triple integrals: **spherical coordinates**, written as $\\rho,\\phi$, and $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The outline of this lecture is as follows. First we will go over what $\\rho,\\phi$, and $\\theta$ represent, and how to convert between them and rectangular $x,y,z$ coordinates. Next we will give a derivation of the volume form $\\mathop{dV} = \\rho^2 \\sin(\\phi) \\mathop{d\\phi}\\mathop{d\\rho}\\mathop{d\\theta}$. Finally we will practice setting up the endpoints of a triple integral using spherical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "### By the end of this lecture and recitation, you will be able to:\n",
    "### 1. Find the rectangular, cylindrical, and **spherical coordinates** of a given point in 3D space.\n",
    "### 2. Set up and solve integrals using spherical coordinates, including finding the **limits of integration** for appropriate 3D solids (e.g. portions of spheres).\n",
    "### 3. **Solve gravitational attraction problems** in three dimensions using spherical coordinates."
